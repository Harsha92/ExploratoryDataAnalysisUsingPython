# **Problem Statement**

As part of this project we are considering two lists of monthly revenue and monthly expenditure to calculate the profit or loss for the given financial year for a company.  Below are the tasks that are performed on the data
financial metrics:

- profit or loss for each month
- profit or loss after tax for each month (the tax rate is 20%)
- profit margin for each month - equals to profit after tax divided by revenue
- good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year
- bad months - where the profit after tax was less than the mean for the year
- the best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
- the worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year
